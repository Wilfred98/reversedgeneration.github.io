        <h3>Little History</h3>
        <p>Reversed was started on January 2018.
            The founding member was Edward Kariuki together with his close friends.
            The main aim of the group was to help people such as: the needy, the orphaned, people struggling with drug use e.t.c</p>
       <p>For a period of 2 years we have achieved alot and covered a wide milestone.
           We have gone to various children's home such as <i>Makimei Children's Home</i>
           <i>Msamaria Mwema Children's Home</i>
        We carry out our activities through monthly contributions from each member.
           From five members we have grown to thirty six active participants.</p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
           <p>Our goal is to help our youths who deviated and followed the ways of the world.
               We plan on visiting rehabilitation centers and start feeding programmes in
               the nearby future.
           We're also planning tree-planting activities to increase
               the forest cover in our country.</p>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>Is to have a non-judgmental society where people live in harmony
            by helping each other without fear of any danger.</p>
